/*
    You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. Your task is to perform the following operation exactly k times in 
    order to maximize your score:
    Select an element m from nums.
    Remove the selected element m from the array.
    Add a new element with a value of m + 1 to the array.
    Increase your score by m.
    Return the maximum score you can achieve after performing the operation exactly k times.

    Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
    Output: 18
    Explanation: We need to choose exactly 3 elements from nums to maximize the sum.
    For the first iteration, we choose 5. Then sum is 5 and nums = [1,2,3,4,6]
    For the second iteration, we choose 6. Then sum is 5 + 6 and nums = [1,2,3,4,7]
    For the third iteration, we choose 7. Then sum is 5 + 6 + 7 = 18 and nums = [1,2,3,4,8]
    So, we will return 18.
    It can be proven, that 18 is the maximum answer that we can achieve.
