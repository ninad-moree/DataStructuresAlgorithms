/*
    You are given an integer n denoting the number of floors in a building, where the floors are numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are also given an integer array requests, where 
    requests represents the sequence of floor requests. An elevator starts at floor 0 and follows these rules: The elevator moves one floor per second. The elevator serves 
    requests in the given order. If the elevator is already on the requested floor, no movement is needed. After serving a request, the elevator immediately starts moving 
    toward the next request. Return the total time in seconds required to serve all requests.

    Example 1:
    Input: n = 5, requests = [2,1,4,3]
    Output: 7
    Explanation: requests[0] = 2: Moving from floor 0 to floor 2 takes 2 seconds. requests[1] = 1: Moving from floor 2 to floor 1 takes 1 second.
    requests[2] = 4: Moving from floor 1 to floor 4 takes 3 seconds. requests[3] = 3: Moving from floor 4 to floor 3 takes 1 second.
    The total time required is 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7 seconds.
