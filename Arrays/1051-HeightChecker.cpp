/*
    A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing 
    order by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array expected where expected[i] is the expected height of the ith student 
    in line. You are given an integer array heights representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each heights[i] is the 
    height of the ith student in line (0-indexed). Return the number of indices where heights[i] != expected[i].

    Example 1:
    Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 
    heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
    expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
    Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
