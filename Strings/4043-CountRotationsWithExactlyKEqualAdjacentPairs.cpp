/*
    You are given a string s of length n and an integer k. A cyclic rotation of s is obtained by choosing a prefix of s whose length is between 0 and n - 1 (inclusive), and 
    moving it to the end of the string while preserving the order of all characters. For every cyclic rotation of s, let its score be the number of indices i such that 0 <= i <
    n - 1 and the characters at positions i and i + 1 are equal. Return the number of cyclic rotations of s whose score equals k. A prefix of a string is a substring that 
    starts from the beginning of the string and extends to any point within it. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string, which may be empty.

    Example 1:
    Input: s = "aab", k = 1
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The cyclic rotations of s are: "aab": The characters at positions 0 and 1 are equal, so score = 1. "aba": No two adjacent characters are equal, so score = 0.
    "baa": The characters at positions 1 and 2 are equal, so score = 1. Since score equals k for 2 cyclic rotations of s, the answer is 2.
