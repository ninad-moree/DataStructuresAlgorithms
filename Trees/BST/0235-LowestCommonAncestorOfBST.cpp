/*
    Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
    According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p 
    and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

    Example 1:
    Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
